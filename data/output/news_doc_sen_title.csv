estimates that pure evs will make up 1 per cent of the global car market in 2017.one unexpected hurdle to widespread uptake of evs has been an impressive advance in traditional internal combustion engine technology. ford motor is phasing out the hybrid version of its escape crossover vehicle on the grounds that a new model equipped with its efficient ecoboost engine will outperform the hybrid.according to the us carmakers research, high prices remain the biggest obstacle to consumer acceptance. the electric version of fords small focus, which has just started production in michigan, will sell for $32,500, including a $7,500 us government tax credit. a home battery-charging unit costs a further $1,499. by contrast, the sticker price of a petrol focus is as low as $16,500.sharif marakby, fords global head of electrified vehicles, says firm conclusions on the ev era will have to wait until 2012 or 2013, when carmakers produce them in far greater numbers. we would not be

(see the battle of seattle, 1999.)there were a few exceptions, like the protests that, along with sanctions, helped end apartheid in south africa in 1994. but for young people, radical critiques and protests against the system were mostly confined to pop-culture fantasy: ""fight the power"" was a song on a platinum-selling album, rage against the machine was a platinum-selling band, and the beloved brave rebels fighting the all-encompassing global oppressors were just a bunch of characters in the matrix.""massive and effective street protest"" was a global oxymoron until  suddenly, shockingly  starting exactly a year ago, it became the defining trope of our times. and the protester once again became a maker of history.prelude to the revolutionsit began in tunisia, where the dictator's power grabbing and high living crossed a line of shamelessness, and a commonplace bit of government callousness against an ordinary citizen  a 26-year-old street vendor named mohamed bouazizi  became the final straw. bouazizi lived in the charmless tunisian town of sidi bouzid, 125 miles south of tunis. on a friday morning almost exactly a year ago, he set out for work, selling produce from a cart. police had hassled bouazizi routinely for years, his family says, fining him, making him jump through bureaucratic hoops. on dec. 17, 2010, a cop started giving him grief yet again. she confiscated his scale and allegedly slapped him. he walked straight to the provincial-capital building to complain and got no response. at the gate, he drenched himself in paint thinner and lit a match.""my son set himself on fire for dignity,"" mannoubia bouazizi told me when i visited her.""in tunisia,"" added her 16-year-old daughter basma, ""dignity is more important than bread.""in egypt the incitements were a preposterously fraudulent 2010 national election and, as in tunisia, a not uncommon act of unforgivable brutality by security agents. in the u.s., three acute and overlapping money crises  tanked economy, systemic financial recklessness, gigantic public debt  along with ongoing revelations of double dealing by banks, new state laws making certain public-employee-union demands illegal and the refusal of congress to consider even slightly higher taxes on the very highest incomes mobilized occupy wall street and its millions of supporters. in russia it was the realization that another six (or 12) years of vladimir putin might not lead to greater prosperity and democratic normality.in sidi bouzid and tunis, in alexandria and cairo; in arab cities and towns across the 6,000 miles from the persian gulf to the atlantic ocean; in madrid and athens and london and tel aviv; in mexico and india and chile, where citizens mobilized against crime and corruption; in new york and moscow and dozens of other u.s. and russian cities, the loathing and anger at governments and their cronies became uncontainable and fed on itself.the stakes are very different in different places. in north america and most of europe, there are no dictators, and dissidents don't get tortured. any day that tunisians, egyptians or syrians occupy streets and squares, they know that some of them might be beaten or shot, not just pepper-sprayed or flex-cuffed. the protesters in the middle east and north africa are literally dying to get political systems that roughly resemble the ones that seem intolerably undemocratic to protesters in madrid, athens, london and new york city.

gulf with the indian ocean. like many marine chokepoints, the strait of hormuz has long commanded the attention of empires and their navies.and in recent decades it has become even more critical: one-third of the oil carried by sea passes through hormuz -- that's some 15 million barrels every day, according to the u.s. energy information administration.now iran's vice president is warning that the islamic republic could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. france, britain and germany have proposed such sanctions as punishment for iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program.to demonstrate its intent, iran is holding a 10-day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the arabian sea, with some elements playing the part of enemy forces. western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of iran's volatile behavior, following the occupation of the british embassy in tehran. and it's not the first time iran has used this vital sea lane in a high-stakes game of brinkmanship.the strait is thought to have been named for the persian word hur-mogh, the date palm found on the coast. it was mentioned in a first-century mariner's account, ""the periplus of the erythtraean sea,"" and through the ages was known for its pearls.but as oil became the lubricant of the world economy, the strait of hormuz -- and the sea lanes leading to it -- became a geostrategic flashpoint. so narrow is the strait, with sea lanes just two miles wide heading in and out of the gulf, that ships must pass through iranian and omani territorial waters. in addition, iran and the united arab emirates dispute sovereignty over several islands close to the strait.iran last tried to disrupt and sabotage persian gulf shipping during its decade-long conflict with iraq, when the arab gulf states were funding saddam hussein's war effort. when iraq began attacking iranian tankers in 1984, iran responded by targeting vessels headed to and from gulf ports. and it began a guerrilla war at sea -- laying mines in shipping lanes.that led the u.s. to provide military escorts for kuwaiti shipping. in 1988, an iranian mine damaged and nearly sank the uss samuel b. roberts, prompting u.s. president ronald reagan to order retaliatory strikes against iranian oil platforms and naval vessels. two platforms -- sirri and sassan -- were destroyed and an iranian warship sunk in operation praying mantis.since then, the u.s. has increased cooperation with the navies of gulf arab states and established the headquarters of the u.s. fifth fleet in bahrain.but iran's neighbors understand that their reliance on the strait to transport oil and liquefied natural gas remains vulnerable. according to u.s. diplomatic cables, iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said in december 2009 that ""iraq would be the hardest hit"" if tensions led iran to try to blockade the strait. kuwaiti officials have suggested building a 1,000-mile land pipeline to the gulf of oman to reduce reliance on the maritime route.today, after decades of sanctions, iran does not have the naval power to block the strait, and its aging air force would be no match for u.s. and gulf state fighter jets. but military experts say iran could wage ""asymmetrical warfare"" -- involving mines and attacks by revolutionary guards' patrol boats. it has also developed a class of small submarines, three of which were launched last month, according to the iranian naval commander quoted by the fars news agency.even bellicose language from iranian politicians has already caused jitters in oil markets. earlier this month an iranian legislator, parviz sarvari, warned: ""soon we will hold an exercise on closing the strait of hormuz. if the world wants to make the region insecure, we will make the world insecure.""any attempt to interfere with shipping would be a double-edged sword for tehran. iran also relies on the strait to export its crude and other products, and has to import most of its refined gasoline for lack of refining capacity. the u.s. state department says there is ""an element of bluster"" in the iranian threats.even so, analysts worry that the deterioration in u.s.-iranian relations could magnify the consequences of a collision or provocation in the gulf. shortly before retiring as chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff, adm. mike mullen said: ""if something happens, it's virtually assured that we won't get it right, that there will be miscalculations which would be extremely dangerous in that part of the world.""trita parsi, president of the national iranian american council, told cnn on monday that an incident in the strait ""could spark a wider war precisely because there's no communication, no diplomacy and no de-escalatory mechanisms between the united states and iran.""","it is just 34 miles (55 kilometers) wide and dotted with islands and rocky outcrops, a channel that links the persian

part of enemy forces. western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of iran's volatile behavior, following the occupation of the british embassy in tehran. and it's not the first time iran has used this vital sea lane in a high-stakes game of brinkmanship.the strait is thought to have been named for the persian word hur-mogh, the date palm found on the coast. it was mentioned in a

and the sea lanes leading to it -- became a geostrategic flashpoint. so narrow is the strait, with sea lanes just two miles wide heading in and out of the gulf, that ships must pass through iranian and omani territorial waters. in addition, iran and the united arab emirates dispute sovereignty over several islands close to the strait.iran last tried to disrupt and sabotage persian gulf shipping during its decade-long conflict with iraq, when the arab gulf states were funding saddam hussein's war effort. when iraq began attacking iranian tankers in 1984, iran responded by targeting vessels headed to and from gulf ports. and it began a guerrilla war at sea -- laying mines in shipping lanes.that led the u.s. to provide military escorts for kuwaiti shipping. in 1988, an iranian mine damaged and nearly sank the uss samuel b. roberts, prompting u.s. president ronald reagan to order retaliatory strikes against iranian oil platforms and naval vessels. two platforms -- sirri and sassan -- were destroyed and an iranian warship sunk in operation praying mantis.since then, the u.s. has increased cooperation with the navies of gulf arab states and established the headquarters of the u.s. fifth fleet in bahrain.but iran's neighbors understand that their reliance on the strait to transport oil and liquefied natural gas remains vulnerable. according to u.s. diplomatic cables, iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said in december 2009 that ""iraq would be the hardest hit"" if tensions led iran to try to blockade the strait. kuwaiti officials have suggested building a 1,000-mile land pipeline to the gulf of oman to reduce reliance on the maritime route.today, after decades of sanctions, iran does not have the naval power to block the strait, and its aging air force would be no match for u.s. and gulf state fighter jets. but military experts say iran could wage ""asymmetrical warfare"" -- involving mines and attacks by revolutionary guards' patrol boats. it has also developed a class of small submarines, three of which were launched last month, according to the iranian naval commander quoted by the fars news agency.even bellicose language from iranian

gulf with the indian ocean. like many marine chokepoints, the strait of hormuz has long commanded the attention of empires and their navies.and in recent decades it has become even more critical: one-third of the oil carried by sea passes through hormuz -- that's some 15 million barrels every day, according to the u.s. energy information administration.now iran's vice president is warning that the islamic republic could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. france, britain and germany have proposed such sanctions as punishment for iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program.to demonstrate its intent, iran is holding a 10-day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the arabian sea, with some elements playing the part of enemy forces. western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of iran's volatile behavior, following the occupation of the british embassy in tehran. and it's not the first time iran has used this vital sea lane in a high-stakes game of brinkmanship.the strait is thought to have been named for the persian word hur-mogh, the date palm found on the coast. it was mentioned in a

and the sea lanes leading to it -- became a geostrategic flashpoint. so narrow is the strait, with sea lanes just two miles wide heading in and out of the gulf, that ships must pass through iranian and omani territorial waters. in addition, iran and the united arab emirates dispute sovereignty over several islands close to the strait.iran last tried to disrupt and sabotage persian gulf shipping during its decade-long conflict with iraq, when the arab gulf states were funding saddam hussein's war effort. when iraq began attacking iranian tankers in 1984, iran responded by targeting vessels headed to and from gulf ports. and it began a guerrilla war at sea -- laying mines in shipping lanes.that led the u.s. to provide military escorts for kuwaiti shipping. in 1988, an iranian mine damaged and nearly sank the uss samuel b. roberts, prompting u.s. president ronald reagan to order retaliatory strikes against iranian oil platforms and naval vessels. two platforms -- sirri and sassan -- were destroyed and an iranian warship sunk in operation praying mantis.since then, the u.s. has increased cooperation with the navies of gulf arab states and established the headquarters of the u.s. fifth fleet in bahrain.but iran's neighbors understand that their reliance on the strait to transport oil and liquefied natural gas remains vulnerable. according to u.s. diplomatic cables, iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said in december 2009 that ""iraq would be the hardest hit"" if tensions led iran to try to blockade the strait. kuwaiti officials have suggested building a 1,000-mile land pipeline to the gulf of oman to reduce reliance on the maritime route.today, after decades of sanctions, iran does not have the naval power to block the strait, and its aging air force

damaged and nearly sank the uss samuel b. roberts, prompting u.s. president ronald reagan to order retaliatory strikes against iranian oil platforms and naval vessels. two platforms -- sirri and sassan -- were destroyed and an iranian warship sunk in operation praying mantis.since then, the u.s. has increased cooperation with the navies of gulf arab states and established the headquarters of

gulf with the indian ocean. like many marine chokepoints, the strait of hormuz has long commanded the attention of empires and their navies.and in recent decades it has become even more critical: one-third of the oil carried by sea passes through hormuz -- that's some 15 million barrels every day, according to the u.s. energy information administration.now iran's vice president is warning that the islamic republic could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. france, britain and germany have proposed such sanctions as punishment for iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program.to demonstrate its intent, iran is holding a 10-day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the arabian sea, with some elements playing the part of enemy forces. western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of iran's volatile behavior, following the occupation of the british embassy in tehran. and it's not the first time iran has used this vital sea lane in a high-stakes game of brinkmanship.the strait is thought to have been named for the persian word hur-mogh, the date palm found on the coast. it was mentioned in a first-century mariner's account, ""the periplus of the erythtraean sea,"" and through the ages was known for its pearls.but as oil became the lubricant of the world economy, the strait of hormuz -- and the sea lanes leading to it -- became a geostrategic flashpoint. so narrow is the strait, with sea lanes just two miles wide heading in and out of the gulf, that ships must pass through iranian and omani territorial waters. in addition, iran and the united arab emirates dispute sovereignty over several islands close to the strait.iran last tried to disrupt and sabotage persian gulf shipping during its decade-long conflict with iraq, when the arab gulf states were funding saddam hussein's war effort. when iraq began attacking iranian tankers in 1984, iran responded by targeting vessels headed to and from gulf ports. and it began a guerrilla war at sea -- laying mines in shipping lanes.that led the u.s. to provide military escorts for kuwaiti shipping. in 1988, an iranian mine damaged and nearly sank the uss samuel b. roberts, prompting u.s. president ronald reagan to order retaliatory strikes against iranian oil platforms and naval vessels. two platforms -- sirri and sassan -- were destroyed and an iranian warship sunk in operation praying mantis.since then, the u.s. has increased cooperation with the navies of gulf arab states and established the headquarters of the u.s. fifth fleet in bahrain.but iran's neighbors understand that their reliance on the strait to transport oil and liquefied natural gas remains vulnerable. according to u.s. diplomatic cables, iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki said in december 2009 that ""iraq would be the hardest hit"" if tensions led iran to try to blockade the strait. kuwaiti officials have suggested building a 1,000-mile land pipeline to the gulf of oman to reduce reliance on the maritime route.today, after decades of sanctions, iran does not have the naval power to block the strait, and its aging air force would be no match for u.s. and gulf state fighter jets. but military experts say iran could wage ""asymmetrical warfare"" -- involving mines and attacks by revolutionary guards' patrol boats. it has also developed a class of small submarines, three of which were launched last month, according to the iranian naval commander quoted by the fars news agency.even bellicose language from iranian politicians has already caused jitters in oil markets. earlier this month an iranian legislator, parviz sarvari, warned: ""soon we will hold an exercise on closing the strait of hormuz. if the world

one-third of the oil carried by sea passes through hormuz -- that's some 15 million barrels every day, according to the u.s. energy information administration.now iran's vice president is warning that the islamic republic could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. france, britain and germany have proposed such sanctions as punishment for iran's lack of cooperation

and omani territorial waters. in addition, iran and the united arab emirates dispute sovereignty over several islands close to the strait.iran last tried to disrupt and sabotage persian gulf shipping

1,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16219294,"half a century after the publication of the influential book sex and the single girl, frank assessments of sexual mores are everywhere - in films, fiction and myriad magazine columns. it wasn't always that way, writes karen krizanovich.helen gurley brown didn't invent the single girl. history is paved with unmarried women, among them elizabeth i, emily and anne bronte, susan b anthony and jane austen.but before brown's landmark sex and the single girl, a woman who was unmarried and childless was an oddball.compared with superhero spinsters like florence nightingale and dorothy parker, an ordinary unmarried woman had the whiff of something wrong with her - some obstacle or horrible personal flaw that stopped her from the exalted roles of wife and mother.what brown and her landmark book sex and the single girl did was to show how spinsterhood actually was and to furnish a lively, hilarious chapter-by-chapter guide to its nuances and pitfalls.with chapter titles such as women alone? oh come now!, the availables: the men in your life and the affair: from beginning to end, the book was a runaway hit, selling two million copies in three weeks and making many bestseller lists, including the new york times's.critically, sex and the single girl was either loved or hated - and surprisingly lambasted by some feminists such as betty friedan.a feminist with different views from the first wave of more militant activists, brown knew from her own experience the needs of this new generation of women.a female workforce flooded cities like new york, where cheap secretarial power was needed. along with the invention of the contraceptive pill (the subject of which, along with abortion and lesbianism, was edited from the book's final version), this was the beginning of women competing with men as co-workers and sexual entities.brown didn't see men as the enemy - nor was she necessarily against marriage and children.she agreed that men and children were wonderful, but she emphasised that women must have a life of their own. brown's ""single girl"" became a kind of female james bond armed with powerful social, vocational and sexual know-how.brown once said: ""bad girls go everywhere."" she meant her single girl was someone men wanted and women wanted to be.brown also knew, as a self-confessed shy girl, or ""mouseburger"", that many women didn't want a radical feminist manifesto - they wanted a softer, more alluring role model who could nevertheless deliver machiavellian tips.sex and the single girl (and later on, cosmopolitan magazine) showed women how to get what they wanted by working within the male-dominated society rather than at odds with it and in that way, her approach shows the cunning of ""female thinking"".she encouraged single women to use everything at their disposal to survive and succeed - including sex.on that count, brown can still shock - she said women could have sex with anyone, even married men. once she suggested that women utter specific words during their partner's orgasm, a pavlovian technique to associate her goals with his pleasure.brown's wildly imaginative advice suggested a whole new world of possibilities, many of which were made to sound plausible by brown's unique delivery.as the director of promotion and publicity at bernard geis associates which promoted sex and the single girl, letty cottin pogrebin says: ""[brown] has a way of saying the most outrageous things in the sweetest, most polite voice. she is really preaching equality of a sort that was not seen or heard about.""sex and the single girl's message remains controversial. as observer columnist katharine whitehorn says, ""the thing that was absolutely staggering was that there isn't a single word in [the book] of any of this having any moral consequence at all.""at the time, no-one knew the moral consequences of the 1960s, which until much later in that decade, retained much of the conservatism of the 1950s. brown was merely highlighting a social phenomenon as it happened.the reach of sex and the single girl is wide and long. bridget jones would not exist without helen gurley brown, ditto tv's mad men.mad men's creator and executive producer matthew weiner admits sex and the single girl directly influenced mad men - particularly the character of joan (played by christina hendricks).""the style and thoughts in this book have not disappeared,"" says weiner.
