Reading the papers recently, it's been happening quite a bit.' More...PICTURED: Stunning shots of a freewheeling galaxy from 27m years awayDinosaurs 'ran out of evolutionary steam' before they became extinctRed Planet was once a water world, Nasa images revealDr Mitchell, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a Doctor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics claimed Roswell was real and similar alien visits continue to be investigated.He told the astonished Kerrang! radio host Nick Margerrison: ""This is really starting to open up. I think we're headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction.' Mr Margerrison said: 'I thought I'd stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and there's no debating it.' Officials from NASA, however, were quick to play the comments down.In a statement, a spokesman said: ""NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe.'Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue.'",dailymail.co.uk

""Drilling into the fuel tank is another potential access point but is very dangerous and could cause an explosion from one spark,"" she added.Red diesel – fuel sold to farms that carries a lower tax duty than standard fuel – and domestic heating oil, another form of diesel, are also sometimes stolen for use in cars.Figures collated by NFU Mutual, an insurer specialising in farm insurance, show the value of claims for heating oil theft increased by 153% in the first six months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The east of England was the worst affected region.Costs were partly due to an increase in the number of crimes, which doubled in the first six months of this year, but also due to the cost of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by thieves.The most expensive claim dealt with by NFU Mutual this year for clean-up costs as a result of a damaged tank following an oil theft was over £30,000.Will Howell, spokesman for the insurer, said that red diesel is sometimes mixed with heating oil and engine oil to disguise the dye, to prevent detection during spot checks by the police and Revenue & Customs.Catalytic converters are stolen because they contain precious metals – platinum, palladium and rhodium – which can be recycled. The AA says it has seen an increase in thefts since the beginning of the credit crunch in 2008, when prices for precious metals started spiralling.The catalytic converter was stolen from Jane Green's Land Rover Freelander while it was standing in a car park near her workplace in Wolverhampton. She said: ""When I got back to my car, the police had left a note on the windscreen telling me not to turn the car on but to call them as soon as possible. I did and was told a witness had seen a man with a drill around my car.""Green's catalytic converter had been removed with a saw and drill, causing damage that cost £900 to repair.Aviva's Smith advises that car owners should ideally use garages, or if that is not possible, park in busy, well-lit locations to deter thieves from tampering with their vehicles.      larger | smallerUK newsCrimeMoneyMotoring ·  Petrol pricesMore newsRelated10 Dec 2010Petrol price soars to record high16 Mar 2010Labour must do its fuel duty30 Jul 2008Asda fuels petrol price war13 Jul 2008Driveaway thefts rise as petrol soarsPrintable version  Send to a friend  Share  Clip  Contact us  Article historyOn UK newsMost viewedZeitgeistLatestLast 24 hours1. Man stabbed to death on Oxford Street2.

(JEFF HAYNES - REUTERS)Newt Gingrich needs to stop his parade of excuses for failing to qualify to get his name on Virginia’s GOP presidential ballot. “I think it’s more like Lucille Ball at the chocolate factory. You’ve got to get it organized,” quipped Romney about Gingrich’s Virginia fiasco.For once, I agree with Mitt Romney.The “only failed system” is the Gingrich campaign’s incompetence, not Virginia’s law, which has been in place since 1970.As a person who has written favorably about Gingrich as being the most qualified candidate on the GOP presidential stump, I was shocked by the turn of events in Virginia and offer the candidate some constructive criticism.If both Romney and Congressman Ron Paul could muster the minimum requirement of 10,000 signatures from 11 Congressional districts throughout the state of Virginia, clearly the task of getting on Virginia’s ballot can be met. It’s called following the rules! When you are running for president, excuses like the “dog ate my homework” frankly won’t do.Moreover, what message does it send to your supporters and those weighing support for you that you would want to be President of the United States but can’t even pass the simple test of getting on a large state’s primary ballot?As Larry Sabato, of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told the Richmond Times Dispatch “It also sends a message to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire that his campaign isn’t serious.”It was bad enough Gingrich totally blew it in Virginia, particularly since he leads Romney by 5 percentage points among Republican voters. But his campaign made an awful PR move by casting blame at everything under the sun but the campaign’s lack of organization. First, Gingrich and his campaign manager Michael Krull blamed it on Virginia’s 1970 law calling it “a failed system” instead of taking responsibility for not scoring the goal.Making Gingrich and his campaign look even more arrogant, Krull pledged it would organize an aggressive write in campaign without bothering to read Virginia’s election law which expressly prohibits write-ins during primary voting. Comparisons made by the campaign to this being its Pearl Harbor moment were beyond ridiculous and unhelpful.On Christmas Eve Gingrich made a move in the right direction, admitting it was “our fault” not qualifying for Virginia’s primary ballot. But this was undercut by his insistence the campaign would try to get Virginia’s legislature to change the election law to allow for write in votes.This is zany talk and makes the Gingrich campaign look silly and not serious for two reasons. One, there is no time for such action to occur when the General Assembly reconvenes January 11, 2012.Two, it would negate the hard work of the Romney and Paul campaigns who followed the rules and got the job done. Virginia House Speaker William J. Howell noted: “It’s the law. I like Gingrich, personally. I just don’t think you’re going to see a majority change the law to benefit one person.”",washingtonpost.com

Never Underestimate the Power of MetaphorThough we seldom realize it, metaphors influence our thinking every day in what we read and hear from a multitude of sources. In a 2011 study, Researchers from Stanford University demonstrated how influential metaphors can be through a series of five experiments designed to tease apart the ""why"" and ""when"" of a metaphor's power.  First, the researchers asked 482 students to read one of two reports about crime in the City of Addison. Later, they had to suggest solutions for the problem. In the first report, crime was described as a ""wild beast preying on the city"" and ""lurking in neighborhoods"".After reading these words, 75% of the students put forward solutions that involved enforcement or punishment, such as building more jails or even calling in the military for help. Only 25% suggested social reforms such as fixing the economy, improving education or providing better health care. The second report was exactly the same, except it described crime as a ""virus infecting the city"" and ""plaguing"" communities. After reading this version, only 56% opted for great law enforcement, while 44% suggested social reforms.Interestingly, very few of the participants realized how affected they were by the differing crime metaphors. When researchers asked the participants to identify which parts of the text had most influenced their decisions, the vast majority pointed to the crime statistics, not the language. Only 3%  identified the metaphors as culprits. The researchers confirmed their results with more experiments that used the same reports without the vivid words. Even though they described crime as a beast or virus only once, they found the same trend as before.",psychologytoday.com

Bouazizi lived in the charmless Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid, 125 miles south of Tunis. On a Friday morning almost exactly a year ago, he set out for work, selling produce from a cart. Police had hassled Bouazizi routinely for years, his family says, fining him, making him jump through bureaucratic hoops. On Dec. 17, 2010, a cop started giving him grief yet again. She confiscated his scale and allegedly slapped him. He walked straight to the provincial-capital building to complain and got no response. At the gate, he drenched himself in paint thinner and lit a match.(See pictures of Sidi Bouzid.)""My son set himself on fire for dignity,"" Mannoubia Bouazizi told me when I visited her.""In Tunisia,"" added her 16-year-old daughter Basma, ""dignity is more important than bread.""In Egypt the incitements were a preposterously fraudulent 2010 national election and, as in Tunisia, a not uncommon act of unforgivable brutality by security agents. In the U.S., three acute and overlapping money crises — tanked economy, systemic financial recklessness, gigantic public debt — along with ongoing revelations of double dealing by banks, new state laws making certain public-employee-union demands illegal and the refusal of Congress to consider even slightly higher taxes on the very highest incomes mobilized Occupy Wall Street and its millions of supporters. In Russia it was the realization that another six (or 12) years of Vladimir Putin might not lead to greater prosperity and democratic normality.In Sidi Bouzid and Tunis, in Alexandria and Cairo; in Arab cities and towns across the 6,000 miles from the Persian Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean; in Madrid and Athens and London and Tel Aviv; in Mexico and India and Chile, where citizens mobilized against crime and corruption; in New York and Moscow and dozens of other U.S. and Russian cities, the loathing and anger at governments and their cronies became uncontainable and fed on itself.The stakes are very different in different places. In North America and most of Europe, there are no dictators, and dissidents don't get tortured. Any day that Tunisians, Egyptians or Syrians occupy streets and squares, they know that some of them might be beaten or shot, not just pepper-sprayed or flex-cuffed. The protesters in the Middle East and North Africa are literally dying to get political systems that roughly resemble the ones that seem intolerably undemocratic to protesters in Madrid, Athens, London and New York City. ""I think other parts of the world,"" says Frank Castro, 53, a Teamster who drives a cement mixer for a living and helped occupy Oakland, Calif., ""have more balls than we do.""In Egypt and Tunisia, I talked with revolutionaries who were M.B.A.s, physicians and filmmakers as well as the young daughters of a provincial olive picker and a supergeeky 29-year-old Muslim Brotherhood member carrying a Tigger notebook. The Occupy movement in the U.S. was set in motion by a couple of magazine editors — a 69-year-old Canadian, a 29-year-old African American — and a 50-year-old anthropologist, but airline pilots and grandmas and shop clerks and dishwashers have been part of the throngs.In a new book from TIME, What Is Occupy?
